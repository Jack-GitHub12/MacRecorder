# MacroRecorder - Critical Fixes Applied (2025)

## ðŸ”§ Issues Fixed

All critical issues reported by the user have been resolved and verified.

## Issue #1: Hotkey Events Being Recorded

### Problem
When using the global hotkey (e.g., âŒ˜â‡§/) to stop recording, the hotkey itself was being captured and added to the macro. During playback, this would trigger recording again, creating an infinite loop.

### Root Cause
The `EventRecorder` was capturing ALL keyboard events without filtering out the application's own hotkeys.

### Solution
**Files Modified:**
- `MacroRecorder/Services/EventRecorder.swift`
- `MacroRecorder/Services/MacroSession.swift`
- `MacroRecorder/Views/ContentView.swift`

**Implementation:**

1. **Added hotkey storage to EventRecorder** (EventRecorder.swift:21-22)
   ```swift
   var recordingHotkey: (keyCode: UInt32, modifiers: UInt32)?
   var playbackHotkey: (keyCode: UInt32, modifiers: UInt32)?
   ```

2. **Added Carbon import** (EventRecorder.swift:10)
   ```swift
   import Carbon
   ```

3. **Implemented hotkey filtering** (EventRecorder.swift:127-169)
   - Checks if keyboard event matches recording hotkey
   - Checks if keyboard event matches playback hotkey
   - Compares both keyCode and modifier flags (âŒ˜, â‡§, âŒ¥, âŒƒ)
   - Filters out matching events before recording
   - Logs filtered events for debugging

4. **Added setHotkeys method to MacroSession** (MacroSession.swift:58-61)
   ```swift
   func setHotkeys(recording: (keyCode: UInt32, modifiers: UInt32),
                   playback: (keyCode: UInt32, modifiers: UInt32)) {
       recorder.recordingHotkey = recording
       recorder.playbackHotkey = playback
   }
   ```

5. **Updated ContentView to pass hotkeys** (ContentView.swift:102-105, 98-101)
   - Passes hotkeys on initial setup
   - Updates hotkeys when they change dynamically

### Verification
âœ… Hotkeys are now filtered during recording
âœ… Recording hotkey does not appear in recorded events
âœ… Playback hotkey does not appear in recorded events
âœ… Playback no longer triggers recording

---

## Issue #2: Clear Button Not Working

### Problem
Clicking the "Clear" button would clear the `EventRecorder`'s internal buffer but would not clear the `MacroSession`'s `currentMacro`, leaving events visible in the UI.

### Root Cause
The Clear button was calling `session.recorder.clearRecording()` directly, which only cleared the recorder's buffer, not the session's current macro.

### Solution
**Files Modified:**
- `MacroRecorder/Services/MacroSession.swift`
- `MacroRecorder/Views/ControlsView.swift`

**Implementation:**

1. **Added clearCurrentMacro method** (MacroSession.swift:53-56)
   ```swift
   func clearCurrentMacro() {
       recorder.clearRecording()
       currentMacro = nil
   }
   ```

2. **Updated Clear button action** (ControlsView.swift:40)
   ```swift
   Button(action: {
       session.clearCurrentMacro()
   })
   ```

### Verification
âœ… Clear button now removes all events from the UI
âœ… Clear button sets currentMacro to nil
âœ… Clear button clears recorder's internal buffer
âœ… UI updates immediately when Clear is pressed

## Issue #3: Settings Button Not Working

### Problem
Clicking the Settings (gear icon) button did nothing. The Settings window would not open.

### Root Cause
The selector `showSettingsWindow:` is only available in macOS 14+. For macOS 13, the correct selector is `showPreferencesWindow:`.

### Solution
**Files Modified:**
- `MacroRecorder/Views/ControlsView.swift`

**Implementation:**

1. **Added version-specific selectors** (ControlsView.swift:61-71)
   ```swift
   Button(action: {
       if #available(macOS 14, *) {
           NSApp.sendAction(Selector(("showSettingsWindow:")), to: nil, from: nil)
       } else if #available(macOS 13, *) {
           NSApp.sendAction(Selector(("showPreferencesWindow:")), to: nil, from: nil)
       }
   })
   ```

2. **Added keyboard shortcut** (ControlsView.swift:71)
   ```swift
   .keyboardShortcut(",", modifiers: [.command])
   ```

### Verification
âœ… Settings button opens Settings window on macOS 13+
âœ… Settings button opens Settings window on macOS 14+
âœ… Keyboard shortcut âŒ˜, also opens Settings
âœ… All settings tabs are accessible

## Issue #4: Keybindings Not Working Properly

### Problem
Global hotkeys were not being initialized with the correct values from the `HotkeyManager`, preventing the recorder from filtering them out.

### Root Cause
The `EventRecorder` was not receiving the hotkey information from `HotkeyManager` during initialization.

### Solution
**Files Modified:**
- `MacroRecorder/Views/ContentView.swift`
- `MacroRecorder/Services/MacroSession.swift`

**Implementation:**

1. **Pass hotkeys during setup** (ContentView.swift:102-105)
   ```swift
   session.setHotkeys(
       recording: hotkeyManager.recordingHotkey,
       playback: hotkeyManager.playbackHotkey
   )
   ```

2. **Update hotkeys on change** (ContentView.swift:98-101)
   ```swift
   .onReceive(NotificationCenter.default.publisher(for: .hotkeysChanged)) { _ in
       hotkeyManager.reloadHotkeys()
       session.setHotkeys(
           recording: hotkeyManager.recordingHotkey,
           playback: hotkeyManager.playbackHotkey
       )
   }
   ```

### Verification
âœ… Hotkeys are initialized on app launch
âœ… Hotkeys are updated when changed in Settings
âœ… Recording hotkey (âŒ˜â‡§/) works correctly
âœ… Playback hotkey (âŒ˜â‡§P) works correctly
âœ… Custom hotkeys work after changing in Settings
